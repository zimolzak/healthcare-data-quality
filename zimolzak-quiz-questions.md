# Question 1

Data "cleaning" is (choose **all** that apply):

A. usually not appropriate to pursue, because the "raw" data is the most faithful to the true clincal situation.

B. straightforward, because it can always be compared to an external, gold standard source of truth.

C. mostly complete after we have excluded outliers that are not compatible with physiology, *e.g.,* weight 950 kg, or diastolic blood pressure 800 mmHg.

D. not practical for electronic health record data, because not


## Solution

None of the choices should be selected.

A. incorrect because data cleaning usually *should* be performed. Some analyses are not possible at all without some form of data cleaning. The process should not introduce any inaccuracy but aims to transform the data from a format used for patient care to a format useful for analysis.

B. incorrect because an external source is *sometimes* but not *usually* available to corroborate data elements. Usually we have only one set of measurements per patient at a time point, and we don't know for certain whether they are correct.

C. Incorrect because this addresses only *plausibility.* Other key domains of data quality include *completeness* (what if data are missing or never collected) and *conformance* (data all using the same "language" to describe the same things).

D. incorrect because data cleaning can be accomplished with some effort, but it is not impractical or impossible.
